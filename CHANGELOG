Two releases in 24 hours... Whew! This one is for the coders: mostly performance and robustness improvements.

• Major reliability and speed improvements for the display of posts and comments. In the past, posts and comments were sometimes dropped for no apparent reason. I've made some changes to guarantee delivery of posts and comments to every client. The average latency for the display of new comments and posts also dropped by a factor of 4.

• Improvements to the infinite scrolling system. Made it more visually intuitive, and fixed some glitches that made it break the layout in odd cases. It's much more pleasant now. Thanks to @Laszlo Ricciardi for his comments on this.

• Prevent the user from opening the extension in multiple tabs. Now, if the user clicks on the Syme icon and the extension is already opened, the existing tab will be focused instead of creating a new one.

• Prevent double commenting. While I was at it, I also prevented mass group creation. - thanks @Charles-Alexandre Lacroix!

• Ordered groups by date of last activity, added timestamps to comments, and changed the title of the Settings page to allow to return to the group UI - thanks @Patrick Dube!

• Fixed the user mentioning system not highlighting one's own name - thanks @Charles-Alexandre Lacroix and @Patrick Dube.
